The assignment was to create two programs regarding "Loops".

The directions are as follows: 

Write a program to find prime numbers from 3 to n in a loop by dividing the number n by all numbers from 2..n/2 in an inner loop. [3] Using the remainder (rem) operation, determine if n is divisible by any number. [2] If n is divisible, leave the inner loop. [1] If the limit of n/2 is reached and the inner loop has not been exited, the number is prime and you should output the number. [2] So if the user were to enter 25 [2], your program would print out "2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23". [10]

Write a program to guess a number chosen by the user. In this program a user will choose a secret number from 1..maximum. The program will prompt the user for the maximum value, which the user will enter. [2] The program will then make a guess as to the value of the secret number, [2] and prompt the user to say if the actual number is higher, lower, or correct. [2] The computer will then guess another number until it guesses the correct secret number. [2] The program should use a binary search [3] to narrow its guesses to select its next guess after each attempt.

Run this program for maximum = {100, 1,000, and 10,000}, [1] and graph the result. [1] What can you say about the number of guesses used by the computer? [2]   [15]
